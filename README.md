~The above image is from the "UltraScope" software from Rigol ([available
free on their website](https://www.rigolna.com/products/digital-oscilloscopes/1000/)).
If you want to manually use your computer to control your scope, this is a
good option.~

## Background

## Equipment
- HF antenna suitable for receiving WWV / WWVH
- AM radio receiver
- GPS-Disciplined Oscillator (GPSDO)
- Rigol DS1000E series oscilloscope (we used a DS1102E)
- appropriate cabling to connect audio output of AM receiver to 
one channel of the oscilloscope
- appropriate cabling to connect GPSDO 1 PPS output to a different
channel of the oscilloscope
- USB B to USB A cable
- computer

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- usual SciPy things (numpy, matplotlib)
- [PyVisa](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
(available via pip)
- Rigol drivers (on the [Rigol page for the scope]
(https://www.rigolna.com/products/digital-oscilloscopes/1000/), download
the "UltraSigma Instrument Connectivity Driver")

## Setup

1. Connect all the things.
2. Get the oscilloscope triggering happily off the PPS signal. Verify
you can see the second ticks arriving (as in image above).
3. Run `collect.py`, and data should start flowing!

## References

The Rigol Programming Guide (under the manuals section on their website)
is quite helpful.
